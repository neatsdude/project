---------- Tags -------------

> Tagging the tasks based on tasks name

 task:
 - name: Some task
   <module name>: 
   tags: <specific tag name as task name>

 - name: Example
   service: name=HMA state=started
   tags:
   - starthma

# You can give sam tag name to two different tasks.
# It is called grouping the tags

# Single tag Execution
$ ansible-playbook <playbook> --tags "starthma"

# Executing the multiple tags
ansible-playbook <playbook> --tags "tag1,tag2"

tags:
- always
# This task will always execute even if you skip it
